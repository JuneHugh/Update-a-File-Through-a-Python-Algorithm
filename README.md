# Hello and welcome back!

I am currently working on my certificate and this is actually the 7th course in the certificate. 
I skipped some for the time being because I wanted to learn Python for a specific internship and
before I went to the netherlands to do well in classes. I now understand basic syntax in Python, and I'm excited
to learn more about the language!
